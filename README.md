// Hii! 
This is a small project I've been working on, I wanted to practice more my CSS and Grid work and what better way to do so than to work with a Matching Picture game. 

There are few things I went over in this small project:
- Creating transitional divs that don't require loading of other pages but rather everything is on the same page and awaits it's trigger to move to the next
- CSS animations that give 2000's cyber vibe to the whole project and make it look like an actual indie game
- Browser was giving a lot of issues while trying to give autoplay command so I found a workaround by using mouseover
- Aliging this many grids in such a way to slowly uncover the overlaying image in the background
- Css/JS coccurent work that helps us interact with the grids and flip them while looking for the match (i used a lot of setTimeOut to help me out here)
- Limiting the amount of cards I was able to flip using if and else statment
- Using function to check if every card found its match to finally reveal and deblur the image
- And lastly I set another timeOut for the completion of the game, where it would return us to puzzle__start

I added Luckey Luke as that is one of the kids cartoons I've grew up on and somehow I correlated with the desert theme. Colors are just perfect.
